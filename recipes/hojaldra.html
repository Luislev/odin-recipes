    <h2><em> Description:</em></h2>
    <p> The hojaldra is a typical fried-food of Panama and Colombia, it kinda looks like frybread, but is not the same thing. It's prepared with wheat flour, water, butter, etc. and usually we eat this at breakfast with cheese, sausage, or meat balls in a form of "taco".</p>
    <p> Its a versatile food and easy to do, it will take you about <strong> 1 hour</strong> and with this recipe you're going to have about <strong> 20 portions.</strong></p>
