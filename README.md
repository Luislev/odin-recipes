# odin-recipes
Â¡Hello there! This is my first HTML project learning with TOP (the odin project), currently my goal is to apply all my knowledge about basic elements and atributes of HTML.
This project is about a basic recipe website, and my page will be about recipes from my country Panama.
Later on i will update this README with the thing i applied to the website.
